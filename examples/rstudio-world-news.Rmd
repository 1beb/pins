## News Pin

The following chunks creates a list with the latest world news from the BBC:

```{r retrieve-world-news}
library(xml2)

world_news <- data.frame(title = xml_text(xml_find_all(
  read_xml("http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml"), "///item/title/node()")))
```

We can then run this under RStudio Connecet on, say, a daily schedule; for this to work, you first need to register the `rstudio` using an API Key stored as an environment variable:

```{r}
library(pins)
board_register("rsconnect", output_files = TRUE)
```

And then create, retrieve or find pins as usual; for instnace, we can create a pin for the `world_news` dataframe:

```{r}
pin(world_news, "worldnews", board = "rsconnect")
```
