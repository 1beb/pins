## Setup

The next chunk is useful to collect the secrets string required for scheduled reruns:

```{r eval=FALSE}
pins::use_board("rstudio")$secret()
```

## News Pin

The following chunks creates a dataset with the latest world news from BBC:

```{r retrieve-world-news}
library(xml2)

world_news <- data.frame(
  title = xml_text(
    xml_find_all(
      read_xml("http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml"),
      "///item/title/node()"
    )
  )
)
```

We can then pin this dataset using the secret to allow it to execute, say, daily:

```{r}
library(pins)
use_board("rstudio", secret = Sys.getenv("secret"))

pin(world_news, "worldnews", "A table with the latests world news from the BBC")
```

We can then access this dataset with ease from any notebook that has access to RStudio Connect:

```{r}
use_board("rstudio")
get_pin("worldnews")
```
