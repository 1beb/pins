You can use the `pins` package from **R**, or **Python**, to:

- **Pin** remote resources to work offline with `pin()`.
- **Discover** new resources across different boards using `pin_find()`.
- **Share** resources with your team, or the world with `board_register()`.
- **Resources** can be shareed with GitHub, Kaggle or RStudio Connect boards.

To start using `pins`, install this package as follows:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/pins")
```

You can **pin** remote files with `pin()` to cache those files locally, such that, even if the remote resource is removed or while working offline, your code will keep working by using a local cache:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(pins)

retail_sales <- read_csv(pin("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/prophet/master/examples/example_retail_sales.csv"))
```

You can also cache intermediate results to avoid having to recompute expensive operations:

```{r}
retail_sales %>%
  group_by(month = lubridate::month(ds, T)) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(y)) %>%
  pin("sales_by_month")
```

You can also **discover** remote resources using `pin_find()` which can search CRAN packages and Kaggle. Kaggle requires to configure it by running once `board_register("kaggle", token = "<path-to-kaggle.json>")`. Then we can search resources mentioning "seattle" in CRAN packages and Kaggle with ease:

```{r}
pin_find("seattle")
```

Notice that all pins are referenced as `<owner>/<name>` and even if the `<owner>` is not provided, each board will assign an appropriate one. While you can ignore `<owner>` and reference pins by `<name>`, this can fail in some boards if different owners assign the same name to a pin.

You can then retrieve a pin as a local path through `pin_get()`,

```{r}
pin_get("hpiR/seattle_sales")
```

Finally, you can also **share** resources with others by publishing to particular to Kaggle, GitHub and RStudio Connect. We can easily publish `iris` to Kaggle as follows:

``` r
pin(iris, board = "kaggle")
```

And use all the functionality available in `pins` from Python as well:

```{python eval=FALSE}
import pins

pins.pin_get("hpiR/seattle_sales")
```

There are other boards you can use or even create custom boards as described in the [Understanding Boards](https://rstudio.github.io/pins/articles/boards.html) article; in addition, `pins` can also be used with RStudio products which we will describe next.

## RStudio

You can use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) to discover and pin remote files and [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) to share content within your organization with ease.

To **discover** remote resources, simply expand the "Addins" menu and select "Find Pin" from the dropdown:

<center>
![](tools/readme/rstudio-discover-pins.png){width=70%}
</center>

Notice that, the RStudio connections pane helps you track your pins by providing each board as a connection you can explore:

<center>
![](tools/readme/rstudio-explore-pins.png){width=70%}
</center>

You can **share** local files and content using the RStudio Connect board. Lets use `dplyr` and the `hpiR_seattle_sales` pin to analyze this further and then pin our results in RStudio Connect:

```{r}
board_register("rstudio")
```

```{r}
pin_get("hpiR/seattle_sales") %>%
  group_by(baths = ceiling(baths)) %>%
  summarise(sale = floor(mean(sale_price))) %>%
  pin("sales-by-baths", board = "rstudio")
```

<center>
![](tools/readme/rstudio-share-pins.png){width=70%}
</center>

You can now set the appropriate permissions in RStudio Connect, and voila! From now on, those with access can make use of this remote file locally!

For instance, a colleague can reuse the `sales-by-baths` pin by retrieving it from RStudio Connect and visualize its contents using `ggplot2`:

```{r rstudio-plot-pin, fig.align='center'}
pin_get("sales-by-baths") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = baths, y = sale)) +
    theme_light() + geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = y ~ exp(x))
```
