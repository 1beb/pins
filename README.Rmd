[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/javierluraschi/pins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/javierluraschi/pins) [![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/pins)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pins)

- **Manage** your personal datasets by pinning and retrieving them with `pin()`.
- **Discover** new datasets from R packages, online and in your organization using `find_pin()`.
- **Share** existing **datasets** online and within your organization using `publish_pin()`.
- **Extend** storage locations using **boards** through `use_board()`, you decide where your data lives.

## Installation

You can install `pins` using the `remotes` package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("javierluraschi/pins")
```

## Private pins

You can track your datasets privately by pinning them as follows:

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(pins)

iris %>%
  filter(Sepal.Width < 3, Petal.Width < 1) %>%
  pin("iris-small-width", "A subset of 'iris' with only small widths.")
```

You can then use this dataset as,

```{r}
pin("iris-small-width")
```

A pin is a tool to help you organize content, not the content itself. Therefore, you should not use a pin to store your findings; instead, you should still persist files or check-in reproducible code into GitHub. Pins are here to help retrieve and find datasets.

The motivation behind pinning is to allow you to easily fetch results from past data analysis sessions. This can be useful after tidying your data, since once a dataset is tidy you are likely to reuse this several times and. You might also have a past analysis in GitHub, but you might not want to clone, install dependencies and rerun your code just to access your dataset, that's another good case for using a pin. Another use case is to cross-join between datasets to analyse across multiple projects or help you remember which datasets you've used in the past.

You can find previous datasets using `find_pin()`:

```{r}
find_pin()
```

### Databases

Some datasets are stored in datasets which you usually access with `DBI` and `dplyr`. Let's access a public dataset stored in `bigrquery`:

```{r}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(bigrquery::bigquery(), project = bq_project, dataset = bq_dataset)
```

Which we can analyze and pin with `DBI`:

```{r}
DBI::dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT score, count(*) as n FROM (SELECT 10 * floor(score/10) as score FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.full` WHERE score <= 2000) GROUP BY score") %>%
  pin("hacker-news-scores", "Hacker News scores grouped by tens.")
```

Which we could then use at a later time to experiment with plots and avoid rerunning this query after our session restarts:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

pin("hacker-news-scores") %>%
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = score, y = n), stat="identity") + scale_y_log10() + theme_light()
```

However, you can only using `DBI` when you can fetch all the data back in R; instead, when using `dplyr`, you can pin large datasets and transform them without having to fetch any data at all. For instance, lets pin the previous query using `dplyr`:

```{r}
tbl(con, "bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.full") %>% head() %>% pin("hacker-news-head")
```

This works well while you provide the connection, if your R session gets restarted, you would have to run:

```{r}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(bigrquery::bigquery(), project = bq_project, dataset = bq_dataset)
pin("hacker-news-head")
```
## Sharing pins

`pins` supports shared storage locations using boards. A board is a remote location for you to share pins with your team privately, or with the world, publicly. Use `use_board()` to choose a board, currently only databases are supported; however, `pins` provide an extensible API you can use to store pins anywhere.

### Databases

We can reuse our `bigrquery` connection to define a database-backed shared board,

```{r}
use_board("database", con)
```

Which we can also use to pin a dataset,

```{r warning=FALSE}
pin(iris, "iris", "The entire 'iris' dataset.")
```

find pins,

```{r}
find_pin()
```

and retrieve shared datasets.

```{r}
pin("iris")
```
