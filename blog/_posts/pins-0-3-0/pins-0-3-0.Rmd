A new version of `pins` is available on CRAN! `pins 0.3` comes with many improvements and the following major feaures:
- Support for Azure, S3 and Google Cloud boards.
- A new `pin_info()` function to retrieve additional metadata.

In addition, there is a new [Use Cases](https://rstudio.github.io/pins/articles/use-cases.html) section in our docs, various improvements (see [NEWS](https://rstudio.github.io/pins/news/index.html)) and two community extensions being developed to support [databases](https://edgararuiz.github.io/connections/#pins) and [nextcloud](https://gitlab.com/gwmngilfen/nextcloudr) as boards.

You can install this new version from CRAN as follows:

```r
install.packages("pins")
```
