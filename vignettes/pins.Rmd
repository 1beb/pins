```{r setup, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(nomnoml)
```

A pin, a tool to help you track datasets without worrying too much of where the actual dataset lives. Ideally, `pins` should be able to pin absolutely anything; however, to be able to handle multiple boards, pins need to be scoped to handle only selected data types. The most common object to pun is a `data.frame` and variations like `tibble`. Currently, the `pins` package can attempt to pin the following types of datasets:

```{nomnoml echo=FALSE}
#direction: top
#spacing: 10
[tables |
  [data.frame]
  [tibble]
  [dplyr]
]

[files |
  [json]
  [xml]
  [images]
  [...]
]
```
